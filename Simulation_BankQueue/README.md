Do a program that will simulate a drive-in for a new fast-food place, Taco Fry, where you get good greasy food, Mexican style. 
Translate the pseudocode found in chapter 13. 
You may use a linked list for the eventList. 
Find the average wait for people going through the drive-in. Read the input from a sample file like:

20 5
22 4
23 2
30 3

The output would be:
Taco Fry drive-in
new event A 20 5
new event A 22 4
new event A 23 2
new event D 25
Customer at time 22 had to wait 3
new event D 29
Customer at time 23 had to wait 6
new event A 30 3
new event D 31
Customer at time 30 had to wait 1
new event D 34
Average wait time was 2.5
