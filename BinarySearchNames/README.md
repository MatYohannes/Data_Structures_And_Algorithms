Use the binary search tree code to do the following:

Put the names that follow into a file
Read the file and insert the names into the binary search tree
After all nodes have been read, print the tree using inorder.
Print the height of the tree
Remove Yate and Nancy
Print the height of the tree
Print the tree using inorder
 
George

Bill

Nancy

Antonio

Sally

Mike

Cathy

Zac

Nolan

Kody

Xena

Yate

 

For 10 pts extra credit, have an option 8 that would write the contents of the tree to a file,

inorder, then read it back in to balance the tree (use the algorithm in chapter 16).

Remember that the algorithm works mainly with a full tree. A full tree has the number of nodes of 2h â€“ 1.

If it is less than the nearest full number of nodes, add dummy nodes that start with tilde (~) and a number. 

Then write and read the tree (count the dummy nodes). Remove the dummy nodes.
